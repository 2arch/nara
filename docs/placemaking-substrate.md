# Placemaking on Programmable Substrate: A Layered Abstraction Model for Infinite Canvas Interaction

**December 2024**

---

## Abstract

We present a conceptual framework for understanding user intervention on an infinite canvas substrate. Rather than treating the canvas as a tool with workflows, we propose a *placemaking* paradigm: the canvas is territory, and users construct places within it using layered primitives. We identify eight fundamental layers of abstraction—ranging from atomic cells to autonomous agents—and characterize the connective tissue that enables circulation between them. This framework reveals the canvas as a primeval organism awaiting its nervous system: the scripting layer that transforms spatial connections into functional data flows.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional productivity software presents users with workflows: sequences of operations to accomplish tasks. The infinite canvas inverts this relationship. Users do not execute workflows *on* the canvas—they construct *places* where work can happen. The canvas is not a tool but a territory.

This shift demands a new vocabulary for understanding interaction. What are the materials available for placemaking? At what granularities can a user intervene? How do places afford different kinds of activity?

We propose a layered abstraction model that answers these questions, identifying the fundamental primitives and their compositional possibilities.

## 2. The Eight Layers

User intervention on the substrate occurs across eight distinct layers, ordered from finest to coarsest granularity:

### 2.1 Nucleic (Cells)

The atomic unit. A single cell holds a single character at a single position. All higher structures decompose to nucleic elements. The grain of the canvas.

**Intervention**: Typing, erasing, cursor placement.

### 2.2 Composit (Data, Tables)

Structured aggregation of cells into grids with semantic meaning. Rows, columns, named fields. The load-bearing structure that gives cells relational meaning.

**Intervention**: Table creation, cell editing, schema definition.

### 2.3 Dermic (Notes)

The sprawling text surface. Notes are bounded regions of nucleic material that form a coherent skin—readable, editable, movable as a unit. The interface between raw cells and meaningful content.

**Intervention**: Note creation, resizing, text editing, content authoring.

### 2.4 Vesic (Packs)

Compressed containers. Bundled state that can be stored, transmitted, and unpacked. Memory crystallized into portable form. What a place can hold and release.

**Intervention**: Pack saving, loading, sharing, versioning.

### 2.5 Perceptive (Bounds)

The focused attention regime. A bounded viewport that frames what is visible and manipulable. The threshold that separates here from elsewhere. Where attention concentrates.

**Intervention**: Entering bounded mode, zoom control, viewport navigation.

### 2.6 Agentic (Agents, Objects)

Autonomous actors inhabiting the canvas. Entities with behavior, goals, and the capacity for independent action. The life that moves through places.

**Intervention**: Agent spawning, goal setting, behavior scripting, object placement.

### 2.7 Aesthetic (Monograms)

Visual identity marks. The signature that distinguishes one presence from another. Character and personality inscribed into the substrate.

**Intervention**: Monogram selection, color choice, visual customization.

### 2.8 Vascular (Paint, Paths, Corridors, Connects)

The connective tissue. Runs orthogonally through all other layers, enabling circulation and flow. How movement happens between places. The infrastructure of connection.

**Intervention**: Painting, path drawing, corridor creation, note connection.

## 3. Placemaking as Primary Activity

These layers are not workflow steps but *building materials*. Users assemble them to construct places:

| Material | Contribution to Place |
|----------|----------------------|
| Nucleic | Texture, grain |
| Composit | Structure, load-bearing capacity |
| Dermic | Surface, skin, touchable interface |
| Vesic | Memory, stored potential |
| Perceptive | Threshold, attention boundary |
| Agentic | Inhabitants, life, activity |
| Aesthetic | Character, identity, recognizability |
| Vascular | Circulation, movement, connectivity |

A **laboratory** might emphasize composit (data tables) and agentic (processing agents) layers, connected by vascular paths that carry experimental results between analysis stages.

A **garden** might emphasize aesthetic (visual variety) and dermic (text surfaces for labeling and description), with vascular paths as walking trails.

A **library** might emphasize vesic (packed collections) and perceptive (bounded reading rooms), with dermic surfaces for annotation.

The same substrate affords radically different places depending on how materials are combined.

## 4. The Primeval Organism

The current state of the substrate resembles a primeval organism:

- **Cells** exist (nucleic)
- **Tissues** have differentiated (dermic, composit)
- **Organs** have formed (notes, tables, bounded regions)
- **Skeleton** provides structure (vascular corridors and paths)

What remains nascent is the **nervous system**: the capacity for signals to propagate through the vascular network, for one organ to trigger another, for the organism to exhibit coordinated behavior beyond the sum of its parts.

---

## 5. The Scripting Transition

The missing piece is functional flow. Currently:

```
Note ──corridor── Note
     (spatial relation only)
```

The scripting layer transforms this into:

```
Note ──[data]──→ Note
     (functional flow)
```

Corridors become wires. Notes become components with inputs and outputs. The vascular system carries signals, not just connects endpoints.

This is a phase transition. The substrate shifts from:

- **Drawable** → **Programmable**
- **Spatial** → **Computational**
- **Static connection** → **Dynamic flow**

The organism gains a nervous system. Places become machines. Complex scientific workflows—previously only imaginable—become constructible.

## 6. Interaction Chains as Desire Lines

Not every path through the layers is useful. We seek the *desire lines*: the chains that people actually walk, the traversals that constitute real activity.

**Authoring Chain**: nucleic → dermic → vesic
*Type, grow into note, save as pack. Capture and preserve.*

**Analysis Chain**: vesic → composit → agentic → dermic
*Load data, structure in table, agent transforms, text output. Scientific workflow.*

**Execution Chain**: vesic → perceptive → agentic
*Unpack context, bound attention, agent operates. Focused autonomous work.*

**Navigation Chain**: vascular → perceptive → dermic
*Follow path, arrive at region, read content. Exploration.*

**Composition Chain**: dermic → vascular → dermic
*Note, corridor, note. The circuit pattern.*

These chains are not prescribed workflows but emergent patterns—the paths worn into the substrate by repeated use.

## 7. Design Implications

For the substrate to support robust placemaking:

1. **Primitives must be complete**: Each layer should be fully realized, not partially implemented.

2. **Primitives must be concrete**: Not abstract possibilities but actual, manipulable elements.

3. **Primitives must be undistracted**: Cruft removed, essential operations clear.

4. **Primitives must be selectable**: Users can recognize and choose the right material for their place.

5. **Connections must carry**: The vascular system must evolve to support data flow, not just spatial adjacency.

---

## 8. Conclusion

The infinite canvas is not a productivity tool but a territory for placemaking. Users intervene across eight layers of abstraction—from atomic cells to autonomous agents—using connective tissue to create circulation between them.

The substrate currently resembles a primeval organism: differentiated tissues, formed organs, skeletal structure. The scripting layer represents the emergence of a nervous system, transforming static places into dynamic machines capable of complex, coordinated behavior.

The design challenge is ensuring that placemaking primitives are complete, concrete, undistracted, and selectable—so that users can construct the places they need, from gardens to laboratories, from libraries to workshops.

The canvas awaits its nervous system.
